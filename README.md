## Updates

### image 2024-05-16 ([trueosiris/vrising:2.1](https://hub.docker.com/layers/trueosiris/vrising/2.1/images/sha256-00639c82158711d868f41750aa43f605bd35f5b775725137ef3b0b10ba80b52e?context=repo) or [latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/trueosiris/vrising/latest/images/sha256-00639c82158711d868f41750aa43f605bd35f5b775725137ef3b0b10ba80b52e?context=repo)) 

- Merged with [pull65](https://github.com/TrueOsiris/docker-vrising/pull/65) from [Killerherts](https://github.com/killerherts).<br>
  Logs older than 30 days are cleaned up on server start.
- Merged with [pull52](https://github.com/TrueOsiris/docker-vrising/pull/52) from [Diyagi](https://github.com/diyagi).<br>
  Previous container version can still be grabbed via [trueosiris/vrising:2.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/trueosiris/vrising/2.0/images/sha256-b9142d6f653685c92e25745f48cd205a1ffc7ed4aedef19011b03ab2a03a33c6?context=repo)<br>
  Main fixes are: clean shutdown & complete log to container log. Kudos!
- Added date to the logfile name, so per server launch, a logfile will be created. For now, they will not be automatically cleaned up.
- If you're experiencing [this issue](https://github.com/TrueOsiris/docker-vrising/issues/51) with "[476:488:20240511,134828.926:ERROR http_transport_win.cc:388] HTTP status 403" in the log, pull [trueosiris/vrising:display](https://hub.docker.com/layers/trueosiris/vrising/display/images/sha256-592b9ace78b7228c08134804fa94b0f47766bb9202d86048a0a4ded81f765cda?context=repo) which uses xvfb.
- If you're experiencing [this issue](https://github.com/TrueOsiris/docker-vrising/issues/43) with "wine: Assertion failed at address 00007F79E2C9EA7C (thread 0094)" in the log, u might need the latest wine from winehq, therefore grab [trueosiris/vrising:winehq](https://hub.docker.com/layers/trueosiris/vrising/winehq/images/sha256-f7f662258b30d6250d16718aa008a95b868336c92fdd98e56fd39bbca5626f8c?context=repo)

### V-Rising 1.0 update

- The game is working perfectly with a new run of the container (from scratch). I'm on it with several buddies and <i>tested</i> for 3 hours.
- When the server is passworded, joining via Steam seems <b>not</b> possible. Use the ingame server list to join.
- Make sure `HOST_SETTINGS_LISTEN_ON_STEAM: "true"` and `HOST_SETTINGS_LISTEN_ON_EOS: "true"` are set in your Environment
- Launching the server can take up to 10 minutes, even on a fast system, certainly with an existing save. Below is a screenshot of the end of the docker log of a functioning server, at the time we are able to connect to it.

## Docker cli

```bash
docker run -d --name='vrising' \
--net='bridge' \
--restart=unless-stopped \
-e TZ="Europe/Paris" \
-e HOST_SETTINGS_NAME="trueosiris-V" \
-v '/path/on/host/server':'/home/steam/vrising/server':'rw' \

```

## docker-compose.yml

See the example docker-compose.yml in this repository.

## Kubernetes

You can use the provided example in `kubernetes/kustomize/overlays/exampleorg` to see the ways the base template could be adjusted to your requirements.
It's important to *at least* change the following:
- secret.yaml - Your RCON Secret, if you need one
- pvc.yaml - Adjust `storageClassname` and requsted storage according to your needs
- deployment.yaml - Set Image path to your registry. This image is not pushed to dockerhub by default

To update your Pod, just delete it and wait for it to restart.

## RCON <small>- Optional</small>

To enable RCON set the `HOST_SETTINGS_RCON_ENABLE`, `HOST_SETTINGS_RCON_PASSWORD`, `HOST_SETTINGS_RCON_PORT` variables. To communicate using RCON protocal use the [RCON CLI](https://github.com/gorcon/rcon-cli) by gorcon.


## Remarks

-   Server config files are in `/path/on/host/persistentdata/Settings`. 
    Files in `/path/on/host/server/` are overwritten on Steam update. <br>
    Priority of settings is

    - container variables
    - files in /server. (and these are reset to defaults each new patch)

    Please note that you cannot edit your config files in `$PERSISTENT_DATA_PATH/Settings/ServerGameSettings.json` or `$PERSISTENT_DATA_PATH/Settings/ServerHostSettings.json`, these will be overwritten by your ENV every time the container is restarted. In case you want to adjust any setting that isn't covered by the current config options, please create an issue or a PR.
- If you use different internal & external ports, you can only use direct connect. For example `-p 12345:6789/udp` container port 6789 as defined in ServerHostSettings.json, and exposed as 12345 will make your server invisible ~~, even if  `"ListOnMasterServer=true"`~~
- If you want to see the server in the server list and want to use 27015-27016/UDP, you'll need to change the ports to 27015 and 27016. Then expose these ports (below). Of course, forward these udp ports on your firewall from incoming wan to the ports on the internal ip of your dockerhost.

  - Start the container & let the server install.
  - Stop the container.
  - Alter the ports to
    ```
     GAME_PORT: "27015"
     QUERY_PORT: "27016"
    ```
  - On your firewall, port forward incoming wan udp ports 27015 and 27016 to the same udp ports on your dockerhost ip.
  - Restart the container with these ports:
    ```
     -p 27015:27015/udp
     -p 27016:27016/udp
    ```
- If you want to continue from your local game, stop the container, overwrite the persistentdata
  contents with your local data, and relaunch the server.

## Docker log

The log of a functional server in 1.0 should look like this:
